In November 2018, I coordinated a workshop in Newcastle with artist, Jayne Dent, and colleagues from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine. We brought together a group of people living with cancer, and taught them the process of mono-printing. We then worked with them to create two mono-prints that represented two points in their lives that had been affected by their cancer diagnosis. The resulting artworks were emotional and insightful. 


The work was exhibited at the Newcastle Central Library, the 2019 NCRI and NHS England Living With and Beyond Cancer event in Manchester, and at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 

We are currently seeking further funding to expamd this project throughout the UK.
