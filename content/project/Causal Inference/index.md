In April 2019 I moved to the Karolinska Instituet in Stockholm, Sweden, to work with Professor Miguel Hernan. We are currently developing a range of projects with the main aim of advancing causal inference methodologies applied to Swedish registry data. The includes understanding how we can use these obersvational big datasets to emulate randoized trials.
