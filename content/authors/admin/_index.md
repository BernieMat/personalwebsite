bio: I am an experienced statistical epidemiologist and health data scientist, currently working at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. My interests are in understanding how we can use big data to clearly answer important questions about the causes and effects of interventions. This includes developing and applying advanced methodologies to predict and understand what will happen if an individual takes one course of action over another. I have extensive programming experience using several languages (mainly R, SQL, and Stata), to handle large datasets (>1m entries).
