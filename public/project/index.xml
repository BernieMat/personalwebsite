      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2019 I moved to the Karolinska Instituet in Stockholm, Sweden, to work with Professor Miguel Hernan. We are currently developing a range of projects with the main aim of advancing causal inference methodologies applied to Swedish registry data. The includes understanding how we can use these obersvational big datasets to emulate randoized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2018, I coordinated a workshop in Newcastle with artist, Jayne Dent, and colleagues from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine. We brought together a group of people living with cancer, and taught them the process of mono-printing. We then worked with them to create two mono-prints that represented two points in their lives that had been affected by their cancer diagnosis. The resulting artworks were emotional and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was exhibited at the Newcastle Central Library, the 2019 NCRI and NHS England Living With and Beyond Cancer event in Manchester, and at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeking further funding to expamd this project throughout the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
